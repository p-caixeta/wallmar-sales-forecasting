# Wallmart Sales Forecasting (kaggle)
This is a repository for the kaggle competition "walmart sales forecasting"

I was asked to completed this competition as a job acessement, and I decided to put it up here, and work a few changes.

The initial commit was as I turned it in, but now I'm trying to implement the Particle-Swarm-Optimization method in order to tune in the parameters while forecasting
